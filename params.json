{"name":"Cell Biology Virtual Lab - 1","tagline":"This repository holds the sources of Cell Biology Virtual Lab I developed by AmritaCREATE, Amrita University","body":"### Cell Biology Virtual Lab I developed by AmritaCREATE, Amrita University\r\nCell biology is an exciting and dynamic area that helps discover the fascinating world of cells. It includes the study of the structure and organization, growth, regulation, movements and interaction of the cells. Cell biology is closely related to other areas of biology such as genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry.\r\n\r\n### Amrita Virtual Labs, Amrita University\r\nVirtual Lab at Amrita Intelligent development of virtual laboratories with state-of-the-art computer simulation technology to create real world environments and problem handling capabilities is required to bridge the gap between institutions (or industries) that retain the physical laboratory and distantly placed economically challenged educational institutions.\r\n \r\nA virtual laboratory is a tool for distance learning and/or experimentation that allows people to share knowledge, data, voice, video, tools, and many other resources. It provides a suitable environment to extend, improve, integrate, refine, and assist the learning and/or experimentation process of many subjects, thus contributing to an increase of the effectiveness of scientific research and widening the use of scarce or costly equipments. The diversity of models and structures for virtual laboratories is large and varies according to the nature of the project under investigation, the goals, and the technologies involved.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@amritacreate\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThese experiments and labs will be hosted for open access through the main project website http://vlab.co.in and at the university link http://vlab.amrita.edu/?sub=3&brch=187","google":"UA-254910-22","note":"Don't delete this file!
